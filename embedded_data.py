Ex-employee and filmmaker Genya Tachibana decides to honor this occasion with a commemorative documentary about the company's star actress: Chiyoko Fujiwara, the reclusive sweetheart of Shouwa Era cinema. Having finally obtained permission to interview the retired starlet, an enamored Genya drags along cynical cameraman Kyouji Ida to meet her, ready to put his lifelong idol back in the spotlight once more.\n\nHidden in this secluded mountain retreat is a thousand years of history condensed into one lifetime, waiting to be narrated. Chiyoko's recollections take them on an illusionary journey through Japanese cinematic history that transcends the boundaries of reality; the saga of her acting career intertwines with her filmography, the actors in her life blend seamlessly with the characters on screen, and the present melds with the past. Though the actress may have retired at the height of her career 30 years ago, the curtain on her life's stage has yet to fall.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"}, {"id": 31812, "name_en": "Black Butler: Book of the Atlantic", "name_jp": "劇場版 黒執事 Book of the Atlantic", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/85792.jpg", "genres": ["Action", "Mystery", "Supernatural"], "themes": ["Historical", "Mythology"], "demographics": ["Shounen"], "studios": ["A-1 Pictures"], "year": 2017, "episodes": 1, "source": "Manga", "score": 8.24, "synopsis": "The young Earl Ciel Phantomhive—the Queen's Guard Dog—is once again called to investigate seemingly supernatural phenomena when news of miraculous resurrections begins to surface in Victorian London.

One day, after having a strange dream in which a ferret gets injured, she sees the very same ferret in real life and rescues it. That ferret turns out to be Yuuno Scrya, a mage from another world who is trying to capture the 21 scattered Jewel Seeds before they cause serious damage to the universe. Yuuno is not powerful enough to capture the Jewel seeds on his own, so he grants Nanoha the intelligent device \"Raising Heart\" and begins training her as a mage.  \n\nUnfortunately, the powerful Jewel Seeds attract those with ill intentions. Another mage, Fate Testarossa, is desperate to collect the seeds for some unknown and sinister purpose, though the solemn look in her eyes makes Nanoha think that there is more to Fate than meets the eye. Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st is a retelling of the original series, which tells the story of two young mages and how their strong emotions shape their actions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"}, {"id": 10080, "name_en": "The World God Only Knows II", "name_jp": "神のみぞ知るセカイ II", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/11/30030.jpg", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance", "Supernatural"], "themes": ["Harem", "Otaku Culture"], "demographics": ["Shounen"], "studios": ["Manglobe"], "year": 2011, "episodes": 12, "source": "Manga", "score": 7.86, "synopsis": "Keima Katsuragi, the \"God of Conquest,\" returns to his quest of expelling runaway spirits that have possessed the hearts of women.

Its mission: to raise Death Scythes for the Shinigami to wield against the many evils of their fantastical world. These Death Scythes, however, are not made from physical weapons; rather, they are born from human hybrids who have the ability to transform their bodies into Demon Weapons, and only after they have consumed the souls of 99 evil beings and one witch's soul.\n\nSoul Eater Evans, a Demon Scythe who only seems to care about what's cool, aims to become a Death Scythe with the help of his straight-laced wielder, or meister, Maka Albarn. The contrasting duo work and study alongside the hot headed Black☆Star and his caring weapon Tsubaki, as well as the Shinigami's own son, Death the Kid, an obsessive-compulsive dual wielder of twin pistols Patty and Liz.\n\nAs they take on missions to collect souls and protect the city from the world's threats, the Shibusen students work together under the snickering sun to become sounder in mind, body, and soul.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"}, {"id": 50739, "name_en": "The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten", "name_jp": "お隣の天使様にいつの間にか駄目人間にされていた件", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1240/133638.jpg", "genres": ["Romance"], "themes": ["School"], "demographics": [], "studios": ["Project No.9"], "year": 2023, "episodes": 12, "source": "Light novel", "score": 7.85, "synopsis": "Mahiru Shiina is worthy of her nickname \"Angel\": she is a divine beauty loved by all, and she excels in both academics and athletics.
